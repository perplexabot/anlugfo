"""
You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix mat and an integer k. You have to cyclically right
    shift odd indexed rows k times and cyclically left shift even indexed rows k times.

Return true if the initial and final matrix are exactly the same and false otherwise.

Example 1:
    Input: mat = [[1,2,1,2],[5,5,5,5],[6,3,6,3]], k = 2
    Output: true
    Explanation:
        Initially, the matrix looks like the first figure.
        Second figure represents the state of the matrix after one right and left cyclic shifts to
            even and odd indexed rows.
        Third figure is the final state of the matrix after two cyclic shifts which is similar to
            the initial matrix.
        Therefore, return true.

Example 2:
    Input: mat = [[2,2],[2,2]], k = 3
    Output: true
    Explanation: As all the values are equal in the matrix, even after performing cyclic shifts the
        matrix will remain the same. Therefeore, we return true.

Example 3:
    Input: mat = [[1,2]], k = 1
    Output: false
    Explanation: After one cyclic shift, mat = [[2,1]] which is not equal to the initial matrix.
        Therefore we return false.

Constraints:
    - 1 <= mat.length <= 25
    - 1 <= mat[i].length <= 25
    - 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 25
    - 1 <= k <= 50
